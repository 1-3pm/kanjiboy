A no-frills kanji randomiser in both directions.

This is a very simple Japanese kanji quiz, based on James Heisig's book Remember the Kanji, 6th edition, as extracted from <a href="https://github.com/sdcr/heisig-kanjis/commits?author=sdcr">sdcr</a>.

Enter up to which frame you want to be tested. It defaults to 2200 (volume 1), but the script includes all kanji up to 3000 (volume 1 + 3).

Click the Keyword button to show a random keyword. Click it again to show the corresponding kanji and its frame number. Click it again for the next random keyword. Or do it in the opposite direction with the Kanji button.

I made this quiz because I sometimes just want to see a random keyword or kanji, outside of the SRS ecology. It's my first project. Enjoy!
